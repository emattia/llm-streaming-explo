      "Ah, a curious question! The sky appears blue because of the way light scatters as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere. When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules absorb some of the light, but they scatter the shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) more than the longer wavelengths (like red and orange). This is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n",

The same principle applies to why the ocean appears blue - it's not because of any actual blue color in the water itself, but rather because of the way light scatters as it travels through the water and into our eyes.\n",

This is known as Rayleigh scattering.\\n\\nAs a result of this scattering, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere, giving the sky its characteristic blue color. The blue color can also be affected by other factors such as the amount of dust and water vapor in the air, but the main cause of the blue color of the sky is Rayleigh scattering.\\n\\nSo, to summarize: the sky appears blue because of the way light is scattered in the Earth's atmosphere, with the shorter blue wavelengths being scattered more than the longer red wavelengths.\",\n",
